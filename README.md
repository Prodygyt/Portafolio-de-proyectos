# Portfolio of Projects
This repository contains a collection of some of my most notable projects. Below are brief descriptions of each project.

## [1. Prepanet Mobile and Web Apps](https://github.com/alex-moons/prepaNet)
### Technologies Used
<ul><li>React</li></ul>
<ul><li>Swift</li></ul>

### Description
The project consisted in the development of web app and an IOS app where students could enroll into courses and check the status of their progress. 

### My Contributions
<ul><li>Developed backend functionalities related to routing.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Prevented direct URL navigation with guards as cookies.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Implemented a role navigation system with different access levels with token decryption.</li></ul>

## [2. Self-Driving Car Simulation](https://github.com/5100-chap/Multiagentes)
### Technologies Used
<ul><li>Unity</li></ul>
<ul><li>Python</li></ul>

### Description
The project consisted in the development of a 3D simulation of city traffic in Unity. We needed to create the 3D models of the buildings, the cars and some streets. We also needed to develop the behaviour of the traffic using dijkstra as a pathfinding algorithm and ML-Agents library to train the cars.  

### My Contributions
<ul><li>Developed a 3D simulation of a city using Unity.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Created a Dijkstra algorithm to guide the cars to their destination with the help of waypoints distributed around the city.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Implemented a reinforcement learning model to train the cars by establishing a hierarchy system for decision-making.</li></ul>

## 3. Reverse Engineering Flipper Zero
### Technologies Used
<ul><li>C</li></ul>
<ul><li>Python</li></ul>

### Description
The project consisted on building from scratch the internal hardware of a product similar to Flipper Zero. The only given limitations were the dimensions, since the client gave the team the case of the product. We also needed to integrate the firmware with modifications to the hardware.

### My Contributions
<ul><li>Replicated the internal hardware of Flipper Zero by cutting and modifying generic circuit boards.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Recreated the firmware of Flipper Zero by utilizing the company's Github repository.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Improved the RFID clone module to encompass more types of credit cards and proximity cards.</li></ul>
